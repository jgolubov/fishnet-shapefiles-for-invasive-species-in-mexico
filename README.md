# fishnet-shapefiles-for-invasive-species-in-mexico
This a is short R program to create fishnets based on INEGI 1:25,000 topographic maps of Mexico and create 5 x 5 minute fishnets. It was originally made in ArcView 3.2. We are working on a Java version that can be used directly in QGIS but that will take some time. Meanwhile this seems to work fine.
